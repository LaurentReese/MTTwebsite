# Check the mtt-sloppy.json file
# Then,

# 1) To start the images (frontend and backend, see mtt-sloppy.json)
sloppy start --var=domain:mtt-habitat.sloppy.zone mtt-sloppy.json

# 2) If new images to build, then delete the old ones (can by done on the sloppy site as well)
sloppy delete mtt-habitat

# 3) To verify it's running ok
sloppy show
sloppy show mtt-habitat
